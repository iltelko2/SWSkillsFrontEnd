***For further developing***

open folder in Project directory in VS Code
type "npm installs" first to create node packages in terminal and in project folder
(not all are needed to run the project -- you just need vite as mentioned above, but if code changes are needed all the following are mentioned here) -->
npm install node-sass
npm install react react-router-dom
npm install vite 
npm install @vitejs/plugin-react

and open 2 terminals:
* in 1st terminal type npm run sass (test it by modifying content of any scss file & save it -- to trigger creation of css file)
* in 2nd terminal type npm run dev

***Deployment***

(first commit all changes and push to github)
npm run build
npm run deploy
